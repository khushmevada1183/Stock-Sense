# API Service Refactoring Plan

This directory contains the plan and implementation examples for refactoring the API services in the Indian Stock Sense application.

## Overview

The current API service architecture has several issues:
- Multiple overlapping service files with duplicate functionality
- Inconsistent import patterns and usage across components
- Mixed TypeScript and JavaScript implementations
- Inconsistent error handling and data normalization

This refactoring plan aims to create a unified, maintainable API architecture with clear separation of concerns, consistent patterns, and improved error handling.

## Documentation

The following documents outline the refactoring plan:

- [API Refactoring Plan](./api-refactoring-plan.md): Detailed analysis of current issues and implementation plan
- [Compatibility Layer](./compatibility-layer.md): Plan for maintaining backward compatibility during migration
- [Component Migration Guide](./component-migration-guide.md): Step-by-step guide for updating components to use the new API

## Implementation Examples

The `implementation-examples` directory contains sample implementations of the new API architecture:

- `config.ts`: Centralized API configuration
- `client.ts`: Core API client with caching, error handling, and retry logic
- `types.ts`: Shared type definitions
- `index.ts`: Main entry point exporting all services
- `utils/normalizers.ts`: Data normalization utilities
- `utils/endpoint-discovery.ts`: Endpoint discovery and caching utilities
- `services/stocks.ts`: Example service implementation for stocks

## Migration Process

The migration will follow these phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Build the new API layer without modifying existing code
2. **Phase 2**: Create a compatibility layer for backward compatibility
3. **Phase 3**: Gradually migrate components to use the new API
4. **Phase 4**: Remove legacy code once all components are migrated

## Benefits

This refactoring will provide several benefits:

- **Improved maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and consistent patterns
- **Better error handling**: Centralized error handling with retry logic
- **Enhanced performance**: Optimized caching and API key rotation
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types throughout
- **Easier testing**: More modular code that's easier to test
- **Better developer experience**: Consistent API patterns and documentation

## Getting Started

To start implementing the refactoring plan:

1. Review the documentation to understand the approach
2. Create the new API structure following the implementation examples
3. Implement the compatibility layer for backward compatibility
4. Begin migrating components following the migration guide

## Timeline

The estimated timeline for this refactoring is 4-5 weeks:

- Week 1: Core API client and configuration
- Week 2: Service modules implementation
- Week 3: Compatibility layer and initial component migration
- Week 4: Complete component migration and testing
- Week 5: Documentation and cleanup
