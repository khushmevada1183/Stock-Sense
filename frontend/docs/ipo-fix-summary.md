# Recently Listed IPOs Section Fix Summary

## Issue
The Recently Listed IPOs section was not displaying any data despite the statistics showing 53 recently listed IPOs. 

## Root Cause Analysis
After investigation, we discovered the following issues:

1. Field name mismatches between API and UI components:
   - API returns `name` instead of `company_name`
   - API returns `listing_gains` (decimal value like -0.09) instead of `listing_gain` (formatted string like "-9.00%")
   - API returns numeric `issue_price` instead of string `ipo_price`

2. Data validation issues:
   - The validation logic was looking for `ipo.name` but not checking for `ipo.company_name` as a fallback
   - Improper handling of decimal listing gains values

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced SimpleIpoCard Component
- Improved the handling of listing gain values:
  - Added robust `getGainColorClass()` to handle both decimal and formatted values
  - Enhanced `formatGain()` to properly convert decimal values to percentage strings
- Added helpful utility functions:
  - `formatPrice()` to ensure consistent price formatting
  - `formatDate()` to standardize date display
- Improved company name handling: `{ipo.name || ipo.company_name || 'Unknown Company'}`

### 2. Improved Data Processing in mapToIpoItem
- Added a comprehensive `formatListingGain()` helper function to handle all possible gain formats
- Enhanced field normalization to handle API response variations

### 3. Enhanced Validation Logic
- Updated validation criteria to look for either `name` OR `company_name`
- Added detailed diagnostic logging to identify and track problematic data items
- Improved error messages for better troubleshooting

### 4. Added Testing and Diagnostics
- Created debug tools to inspect data flow
- Added comprehensive test case handling for various listing gain formats
- Enhanced error states with helpful user feedback and retry options

## Result
The Recently Listed IPOs section now properly displays all valid IPO data from the API:
- Correctly shows company names
- Properly formats and color-codes listing gains/losses
- Handles all variations of API data fields

## Future Improvements
- Consider adding a server-side data normalization layer
- Implement a schema validation system to validate API responses
- Add centralized data transformation utilities to standardize handling across components
