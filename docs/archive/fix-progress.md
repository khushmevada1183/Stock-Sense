# Fix for Progress Component Issue

If you're seeing this error:

```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-progress'
```

Follow these steps to resolve it:

## Option 1: Install the Radix UI Progress Component

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-progress
```

Then restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Option 2: Use the Custom Implementation (Already Done)

We've updated the Progress component to use a custom implementation that doesn't rely on @radix-ui/react-progress. This change should already be in place in your codebase.

The file is at `components/ui/progress.tsx` and uses a simplified implementation with standard React components.

To ensure this fix is applied:

1. Make sure your code in `components/ui/progress.tsx` doesn't import from '@radix-ui/react-progress'
2. Check that it uses a standard div element with styling rather than Radix UI components

## Option 3: Clean and Reinstall

If you're still having issues:

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
npm run clean

# Or perform a full cleanup and reinstall
npm run clean:all
```

These commands have been added to your package.json scripts.

After cleaning, restart the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Stock Analyzer Application Fixes

## Port Configuration Issues Fixed

1. **Backend Port Conflicts**
   - Updated default port from 5001 to 5002 in the backend server.js file
   - Created .env file with proper PORT=5002 configuration
   - Modified run.js to use 5002 as the default backend port

2. **Frontend Port Conflicts**
   - Updated the Next.js dev script to use port 3001 by default
   - Created .env.local with proper API URL pointing to port 5002
   - Modified fix-api-ports.js script to update all hardcoded API references

3. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Fixed next.config.js by removing deprecated experimental and serverComponents options
   - Updated compiler options for compatibility with Next.js 15.x

## Next.js Client Component Directives

Next.js 15.x requires components that use client-side features (like hooks) to explicitly mark themselves as client components with the "use client" directive. Added the directive to:

1. **Layout Components**
   - components/layout/Header.tsx
   - components/layout/Footer.tsx

2. **UI Components**
   - components/ui/Toasts.tsx
   - components/ui/ModalContainer.tsx
   - components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx
   - components/ui/SearchBar.tsx

3. **Context Providers**
   - context/UIContext.tsx
   - context/StockContext.tsx

4. **Fixed Import Issues**
   - Updated StockContext.tsx to correctly import and use the apiService instance

## Environment Configuration
   
- Backend (.env):
  ```
  PORT=5002
  FRONTEND_PORT=3001
  STOCK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001
  ```

- Frontend (.env.local):
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5002/api
  ```

## How to Start the Application

1. **Run with start.bat**:
   - This will automatically kill any processes using the required ports
   - Sets up environment variables
   - Starts both backend and frontend servers

2. **Manual Start**:
   - Start backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
   - Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

The application should now run successfully with:
- Backend API at http://localhost:5002/api
- Frontend at http://localhost:3001
