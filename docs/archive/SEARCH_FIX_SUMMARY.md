# Search Fix Summary: Resolving 404 Errors

## Problem Diagnosed
The stock analyzer application was experiencing 404 errors when searching for stocks for two main reasons:

1. **Incorrect API Endpoint Format**: The application was navigating to URLs like `/stocks/itc` which don't exist in the API
2. **Inconsistent Stock Symbol Format**: Stock symbols weren't being properly formatted (uppercase/lowercase)
3. **Missing Fallback Mechanism**: No fallback mechanisms when the primary API endpoint returned errors

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that addresses all these issues:

### 1. Robust API Utility (frontend/utils/api.js)

The new implementation uses a multi-step approach to try various endpoint formats:

```js
getStockDetails: async (nameOrSymbol) => {
  // Try multiple approaches in sequence:
  // 1. /stock?name=itc (original format)
  // 2. /stock?name=ITC (uppercase)
  // 3. /stock/itc (path parameter)
  // 4. /stock/ITC (uppercase path parameter)
  // 5. /symbol/ITC (alternate endpoint)
  // 6. Search and use first result as fallback
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

We've added detailed error logging and user-friendly error messages:

```js
// In SearchBar.tsx
setStockDetailsError(
  error.response?.status === 404
    ? `Stock "${query.trim()}" not found. Please check the name or symbol and try again.`
    : `Failed to fetch stock data: ${error.message || 'Unknown error'}. Please try again.`
);
```

### 3. Case Sensitivity Fix

The API might expect uppercase symbols, so we now try both formats:

```js
// Try with original case
const response = await api.get('/stock', { params: { name: stockInput } });

// Try with uppercase
const upperStock = stockInput.toUpperCase();
const response = await api.get('/stock', { params: { name: upperStock } });
```

### 4. Better Debugging Information

We've added extensive logging to help diagnose issues:

```js
console.log(`Making request to: ${config.baseURL}${config.url}`, config.params);
console.log(`Response from ${response.config.url}:`, response.status);
console.error('Failed URL:', error.config.url);
console.error('Params:', error.config.params);
```

### 5. Field Normalization

We now recognize multiple field formats that might be returned by the API:

```js
// In StockDetailPage.tsx
extractPrice = () => {
  if (!stockData) return 'N/A';
  
  // Try all possible price fields
  if (stockData.latestPrice) return stockData.latestPrice;
  if (stockData.price) return stockData.price;
  if (stockData.current_price) return stockData.current_price;
  // More field variations...
  
  return 'N/A';
};
```

## How It Works Now

1. User enters a stock name/symbol (e.g., "itc")
2. Instead of redirecting to a new page, we make an API call with multiple fallback options:
   - Try standard format: `/stock?name=itc`
   - Try uppercase: `/stock?name=ITC`
   - Try path parameter: `/stock/itc`
   - Try uppercase path: `/stock/ITC`
   - Try symbol endpoint: `/symbol/ITC`
   - If all else fails, search for the stock and use first result

3. User sees detailed stock information on the same page without any page navigation
4. If errors occur, user gets a helpful error message explaining exactly what went wrong

## Benefits

1. **Higher Success Rate**: The multi-step approach dramatically increases the chances of finding the stock
2. **Better User Experience**: No more 404 pages; users stay on the same page
3. **Helpful Error Messages**: Clear feedback when stocks can't be found
4. **Easier Debugging**: Detailed logs help diagnose any remaining issues

## Testing

Test the new implementation with various stock symbols:
- Common stocks: "ITC", "RELIANCE", "TCS"
- Lowercase: "itc", "reliance"
- With exchange prefix: "NSE:ITC"
- Invalid symbols: "XYZABC"
